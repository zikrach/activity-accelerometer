The task is to build a model to classify physical activity based on the accelerometer data. 

The data itself and a paper that contains approaches to parse the data is in this folder.

The preferred result is the Jupiter notebook with the model and all supplementing code inside.

In case of any questions - please refer to the sender to provide details.

Good luck!
